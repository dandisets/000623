description: 'We present a multimodal dataset of intracranial recordings, fMRI, and
  eye tracking in 20 human participants. Intracranial recordings consist of single
  neurons, local field potential, and intracranial EEG activity recorded concurrently
  from depth electrodes targeting the amygdala, hippocampus, and medial frontal cortex
  while participants underwent intracranial monitoring for localization of epileptic
  seizures. Participants watched an 8-min long movie ("Bang You''re Dead") and performed
  a recognition memory test for movie content. 3T fMRI activity was recorded prior
  to surgery in 11 of the same participants while performing the same task. This NWB-
  and BIDS-formatted dataset includes the spike times of all neurons, field potential
  activity, behavior, eye tracking, electrode locations, demographics, and functional
  and structural MRI scans. For technical validation, we provide signal quality metrics,
  assess eye tracking quality, behavior, the tuning of cells and high-frequency broadband
  power field potentials to familiarity and event boundaries, and show brain-wide
  inter-subject correlations. This dataset will facilitate the investigation of brain
  activity during movie watching, recognition memory, and the neural basis of the
  fMRI-BOLD signal.
