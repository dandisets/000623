description: 'We present a multimodal dataset of intracranial recordings, fMRI, and
  eye tracking in 20 participants during movie watching. Recordings consist of single
  neurons, local field potential, and intracranial EEG activity acquired from depth
  electrodes targeting the amygdala, hippocampus, and medial frontal cortex implanted
  for monitoring of epileptic seizures. Participants watched an 8-min long excerpt
  from the video "Bang! You''re Dead" and performed a recognition memory test for
  movie content. 3â€‰T fMRI activity was recorded prior to surgery in 11 of these participants
  while performing the same task. This NWB- and BIDS-formatted dataset includes spike
  times, field potential activity, behavior, eye tracking, electrode locations, demographics,
  and functional and structural MRI scans. For technical validation, we provide signal
  quality metrics, assess eye tracking quality, behavior, the tuning of cells and
  high-frequency broadband power field potentials to familiarity and event boundaries,
  and show brain-wide inter-subject correlations for fMRI. This dataset will facilitate
  the investigation of brain activity during movie watching, recognition memory, and
  the neural basis of the fMRI-BOLD signal.
